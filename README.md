# Advent of Code Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! Here, you'll find my solutions for the annual Advent of Code challenges. These are coding puzzles released daily in December, designed to hone problem-solving and programming skills.

## Structure 📁

The repository is organized by year, with each year having its own folder. Currently, it includes:

- `2024/`: Solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

Each folder contains files named after the corresponding day of the challenge (e.g., `day_01_historian_hysteria.py`, `day_02_.py`, etc.), written in the programming language I used for that solution.
